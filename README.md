This is a pathtracer that I implemented over the course of two computer graphics classes, taken about a year apart during my schooling. Some features that I'm particularly proud of are distributed rendering (using multiple jittered rays per pixel), bounding volume hierarchies, reflections/refractions, area lights, and basic uv mapping.

Disclosure on the naming convention: a while after I initially started the project, I refactored my code to use better programming practices (while also implementing more advanced functionality). Unfortunately, when I originally started this project I chose to use camelCase for everything (variables, functions, and classes). Because I wanted to practice using smart pointers and also implement more advanced functionality in the raytracer, I decided to keep to this standard in order to at least maintain consistency rather than spend time fixing it. I may someday refactor the code to use a slightly more thoughtful convention.
